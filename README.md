# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI

A Python-based Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical interface built using Tkinter.  
The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm and is designed to be unbeatable.

## Why This Project
I built this project to practice:
- Game logic implementation
- The Minimax algorithm
- Recursive problem solving
- Basic GUI development in Python

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay
- Unbeatable AI using Minimax
- Simple and clean Tkinter interface
- Automatic win/draw detection

## How the AI Works (Minimax)
The AI simulates all possible game states using the Minimax algorithm.  
It chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent’s best possible outcome.

Scoring:
- +1 → AI wins
- -1 → Human wins
- 0 → Draw

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Minimax algorithm

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
